## Notes:
- The opkd library uses implicit variable declarations (e.g. variables starting with n are assumed to be integers unless otherwise indicated). To ensure the compiler interprets this code correctly, be sure that the -fimplicit-none flag is not activated in your optfile (it is by default in some opt files!)
